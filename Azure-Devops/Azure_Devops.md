- ### Branching strategy Git Flow/Trunk Based/Feature branching

  ## üåø Git Branching Strategies

| Strategy               | Description                                                                 | Common Branches                   | Best For                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Git Flow**           | Structured strategy with multiple long-lived branches for release and hotfixes | `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` | Enterprises with strict release cycles |
| **Trunk-Based**        | Minimal branching, frequent commits directly to `main` (or via short-lived branches) | `main` (or `master`), short-lived feature branches | Continuous Delivery, Agile teams       |
| **Feature Branching**  | Each feature is developed in its own branch and merged into main             | `main`, `feature/*`               | Teams needing isolation per feature    |

### YAML vs CLassic Pipeline
## üõ†Ô∏è YAML vs Classic Pipeline in Azure DevOps

| Feature                        | YAML Pipeline                                      | Classic Pipeline (GUI)                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition Type**           | Code-based (`azure-pipelines.yml`)                | UI-based (drag-and-drop interface)              |
| **Source Control Integration**| Stored with code in Git repo                      | Stored in Azure DevOps project                  |
| **Version Control**           | Fully version-controlled                          | Not version-controlled                          |
| **Portability**               | Easily reusable across projects/repos             | Not easily portable                             |
| **Review Process**            | PR review enabled for pipeline changes            | No PR review for pipeline config                |
| **Flexibility & Customization**| High ‚Äì full control via code                     | Limited to available UI options                 |
| **Multi-stage Support**       | Supported (build, test, deploy in one YAML file)  | Supported, but less structured                  |
| **Learning Curve**            | Steeper (requires YAML knowledge)                 | Easier for beginners                            |
| **Best For**                  | DevOps teams, CI/CD as code, automation at scale  | Quick setup, small teams, non-technical users   |

### ‚úÖ Summary
- **YAML Pipeline**: Preferred for modern DevOps practices, version control, and complex workflows.
- **Classic Pipeline**: Easier to start with, suitable for smaller or UI-driven teams.


## Build Pipelines vs Release Pipelines

| Aspect                 | Build Pipeline                                 | Release Pipeline                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Compile, build, run tests, and package code    | Deploy built artifacts to various environments   |
| **Trigger**            | Automatically on code commit (CI)             | Manual or triggered after a successful build     |
| **Format**             | YAML or Classic                                | Classic (GUI-based) only                         |
| **Focus**              | Code validation, unit tests, artifact creation | Deployment, approvals, environment management    |
| **Environments**       | Not environment-specific                       | Supports multiple environments (Dev, QA, Prod)   |
| **Approval Gates**     | Not supported directly                         | Supports pre/post-deployment approvals, gates    |
| **Artifact Usage**     | Produces artifacts                             | Consumes artifacts produced by build pipeline    |
| **Versioning**         | Applies version to artifacts                   | Deploys specific artifact versions               |
| **Best For**           | Continuous Integration (CI)                    | Continuous Delivery (CD)                         |

### ‚úÖ Summary
- **Build Pipeline** = CI ‚Üí Validate and package your code.
- **Release Pipeline** = CD ‚Üí Deploy your artifacts to environments with control and approvals.


## Stages,jobs,Steps,Tasks

### üèóÔ∏è 1. **Stage**
- Logical boundary in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy)
- Can contain one or more jobs
- Often mapped to environments (Dev, QA, Prod)

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
      - script: echo Building...
```
###  üë∑ 2. **Job**
- Runs on an agent
- Contains a sequence of steps
- Can run in parallel or sequentially

```yaml
jobs:
  - job: BuildJob
    steps:
      - script: echo Building...
```
### üß© 3. **Step**
- A single task or script that runs in a job
- Steps are run sequentially inside a job
  ```yaml
  steps:
  - script: echo Hello World
  - task: CopyFiles@2
  ```

### üõ†Ô∏è 4. **Task**
- A predefined action like copying files, publishing artifacts, running tests
- Reusable and configurable
   ```yaml
   - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    pathToPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
    artifactName: 'drop'
   ```
