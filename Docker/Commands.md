### Explain Docker volume and bind mount
- In Docker, volumes and bind mounts are two ways to persist data outside a container‚Äôs writable layer, allowing data to survive container restarts or rebuilds.
  - Docker Volume :
    - A Docker-managed storage location stored under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`
    - Data is isolated from host file system
    - Ideal for production use and sharing data between containers
    - How to Use:
    - # Create a volume
    - `docker volume create mydata`
    - # Use it in a container
    - `docker run -v mydata:/app/data my-image`
  - Bind Mount :
    - Maps a specific file or directory from the host system directly into the container.
    - Points to an absolute path on the host
    - Useful for development (live updates from code changes)
    - How to Use:
    - `docker run -v /path/on/host:/app/data my-image`

    

### What is Docker Compose and when to use it
- Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file `(docker-compose.yml)`
- Define and run multiple services (e.g., app, database, cache) together
- Define containers, volumes, networks, and environment in one YAML file
- Easily simulate production with mock services or databases


### What is the lifecycle of a Docker container
- The `Docker container lifecycle` defines the various states a container goes through from creation to termination.
- create: `docker create my-image`
- start : `docker start container_id`
- run : `docker run my-image`
- poause : `docker pause container_id`
- unpause : `docker unpause container_id`
- stop : `docker stop container_id`
- kill : `docker kill container_id`
- rm : `docker rm container_id`
- listall : `docker ps -a`
