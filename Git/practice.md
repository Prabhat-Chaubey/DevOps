### How do you resolve a conflict in Git
- You can use `git status` to identify conflicting files and manually resolve them by editing. After resolving, use `git add` followed by `git commit`.
- Note: `git diff` helps view the conflict but doesn't resolve it.


### How do you undo a commit that hasn't been pushed yet
- You can use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (keeps changes staged), or `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (discards changes completely). `git revert` is used for pushed commits.


### What are Git hooks
-  Git hooks are custom scripts that run before or after Git events (like commit, push). Used for automation like enforcing formatting or running tests.


### How can you see the commit history
- `git log branch name`

### How do you rename a file in Git
- `mv currentname tobechagedname`

### How do you delete a file in Git and commit the change
- `git rm file1.`

### How do you create a new branch and switch to it
- `git branch new_branch`
- `git checkout new_branch`
- `git switch new_branch`
