### How do you resolve a conflict in Git
- You can use `git status` to identify conflicting files and manually resolve them by editing. After resolving, use `git add` followed by `git commit`.
- Note: `git diff` helps view the conflict but doesn't resolve it.


### How do you undo a commit that hasn't been pushed yet
- You can use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (keeps changes staged), or `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (discards changes completely). `git revert` is used for pushed commits.


### What are Git hooks
-  Git hooks are custom scripts that run before or after Git events (like commit, push). Used for automation like enforcing formatting or running tests.


### How can you see the commit history
- `git log branch name`

### How do you rename a file in Git
- `mv currentname tobechagedname`

### How do you delete a file in Git and commit the change
- `git rm file1.`

### How do you create a new branch and switch to it
- `git branch new_branch`
- `git checkout new_branch`
- `git switch new_branch`
  
  




### ‚úÖ Git Interview Questions & Answers (Basic to Intermediate)

#### üî∞ Basics of Git (1‚Äì25)

1. **What is Git, and why is it used?**
   Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code and coordinate work among developers.

2. **What is version control?**
   A system to record changes to files over time so specific versions can be recalled later.

3. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
   Git is a local version control system. GitHub is a remote hosting platform for Git repositories.

4. **How do you initialize a Git repository?**
   `git init`

5. **What does `git clone` do?**
   Clones a remote repository into a new directory locally.

6. **What is the purpose of `git status`?**
   Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.

7. **What is the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?**
   `git add` stages changes, `git commit` saves the staged changes to the repo.

8. **How do you check commit history?**
   `git log`

9. **How do you check differences between commits?**
   `git diff <commit1> <commit2>`

    The local directory where you work on files.

16. **What is the staging area in Git?**
    A file that lives in your `.git` directory which acts as a middle ground between working directory and repository.

17. **What is a commit object?**
    A snapshot of your staged changes with a unique hash, message, and metadata.

18. **What are HEAD and origin in Git?**
    HEAD points to the current branch/ref; origin is the default name for a remote repo.

19. **How do you undo the last commit (before push)?**
    `git reset --soft HEAD~1`

20. **What does `git log --oneline` show?**
    A compact view of commit history.

21. **What is `.gitignore` used for?**
    To exclude files/folders from being tracked by Git.

22. **How do you ignore a file that's already tracked?**
    Remove it from tracking: `git rm --cached <file>`

23. **How do you remove a file from staging?**
    `git reset <file>`

24. **What is the `.git` folder?**
    The internal data storage area for all Git information.

    Merge keeps the commit history; rebase makes it linear.

31. **What is a fast-forward merge?**
    When no new commits diverged; Git moves the branch pointer forward.

32. **What is a three-way merge?**
    Used when branches have diverged; Git uses a common ancestor.

#### üß† Git Internals & Advanced Concepts (76‚Äì90)

76. **What is the structure of a Git commit?**
    It contains a snapshot of changes, author info, message, and parent commits.
