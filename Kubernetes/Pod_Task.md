##  üõ†Ô∏è Task 4: Redis-DB Pod Fix for Kubernetes

### Task Overview

This task involves troubleshooting and fixing a failing **`redis-db` pod** deployed in the `trouble` namespace in a Kubernetes environment. The pod was stuck in a **`CrashLoopBackOff`** state due to a typo in the container's command.

### Problem Description

The `redis-db` pod failed to start properly due to a typo in the command section of the pod definition. Specifically, the command `sleeep` was used instead of the correct `sleep` command. This caused the pod to fail repeatedly, entering a crash loop.

### Solution

The issue was resolved by editing the pod definition to use the correct `sleep` command. After fixing the command, the pod was deleted and recreated to apply the changes.


### Steps Taken

### 1. Check Pod Status

First, the status of the pod was checked using the following command:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n trouble
```
### 2. Inspect the Pod Description
+ The next step was to inspect the pod's detailed description to understand the issue:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod redis-db -n trouble
  ```
+ This revealed that the pod was failing because of an incorrect command.
### 3. Check Logs for Further Details
+ To confirm the exact issue, the logs for the redis-db pod were examined:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs redis-db -n trouble
  ```
### 4. Edit the Pod Command
+ To fix the issue, the pod definition was edited to replace sleeep with the correct sleep command. This was done using the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit pod redis-db -n trouble
  ```
### 5. Delete and Recreate the Pod
After fixing the command, the pod was deleted and recreated to apply the change:
```bash
kubectl delete pod redis-db -n trouble
kubectl apply -f redis-fixed.yaml
```

# üõ†Ô∏è Task 5: Create a Pod with Invalid Image Name

## Task Overview

In this task, we will create a new Kubernetes pod named **redis** using the image `redis:123`, which is intentionally incorrect to trigger an image pull error. The task aims to demonstrate how to create a pod with a specific image and then troubleshoot the issue caused by an invalid image name.

### Pod Specifications

- **Pod Name**: redis
- **Image Name**: redis:123 (Intentionally incorrect)
- **Namespace**: default
- **Container Port**: 6379

---

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Create the Pod Definition File

Create a YAML file to define the pod. The pod will use the `redis:123` image (which does not exist). You can use the following commands:

```bash
nano redis-pod.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: redis
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - name: redis
      image: redis:123  # This is intentionally incorrect
      ports:
        - containerPort: 6379

```
### 2. Apply the YAML to Create the Pod
+ Run the following command to create the pod in the default namespace:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f redis-pod.yaml
  ```
### 3. Verify Pod Creation
+ Check if the pod was created and is in the ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull state due to the invalid image:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n default
  ```

# üõ†Ô∏è Task 6: Update Redis Pod Image

## Task Overview

This task involves updating the image of an existing Kubernetes pod named `redis` from an incorrect image (`redis:123`) to the correct image `redis:5-alpine`.

Since pods in Kubernetes are immutable, we cannot update the image of a running pod directly. Instead, the old pod must be deleted and a new one created with the correct image.

---

## Specifications

- **Pod Name**: redis  
- **Namespace**: default  
- **Correct Image**: `redis:5-alpine`  
- **Container Port**: 6379  

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Delete the Existing Pod

The existing pod was using an invalid image and needed to be removed:

```bash
kubectl delete pod redis -n default
```
### 2. Update the Pod Definition
+ The original redis-pod.yaml was edited to replace the incorrect image:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
  name: redis
  namespace: default
  spec:
  containers:
    - name: redis
      image: redis:5-alpine
      ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
  ```
### 3. Reapply the Pod YAML
+ To recreate the pod with the updated image
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f redis-pod.yaml
  ```

# üõ†Ô∏è Task 7: Create Pod with Environment Variables and Save Logs

## Task Overview

In this task, a Kubernetes pod named `envtest` is created in the `default` namespace using the `busybox:1.34` image. The container runs the command `env && sleep infinity`, and two environment variables are injected into the container. The task also involves capturing the pod's logs and saving them to a file.



## Specifications

- **Pod Name**: `envtest`
- **Namespace**: `default`
- **Image**: `busybox:1.34`
- **Command**: `env && sleep infinity`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `STUDENT_FIRST_NAME`: YourFirstName
  - `STUDENT_LAST_NAME`: YourLastName
- **Log Output File**: `$HOME/k8s_pods/default-envtest.log`


## Steps Performed

### 1. Create the Pod Manifest

A file named `envtest-pod.yaml` was created with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: envtest
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
    - name: envtest
      image: busybox:1.34
      command: ["sh", "-c", "env && sleep infinity"]
      env:
        - name: STUDENT_FIRST_NAME
          value: "YourFirstName"
        - name: STUDENT_LAST_NAME
          value: "YourLastName"
```
> Replace "YourFirstName" and "YourLastName" with your actual name.
+ The file was saved and applied using:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f envtest-pod.yaml
  ```
### 4. Save Pod Logs to a File
+ Log output was saved to the specified location:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p $HOME/k8s_pods
  kubectl logs envtest > $HOME/k8s_pods/default-envtest.log
  ```
