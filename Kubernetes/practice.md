|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Maintains a stable set of pod replicas                                      | Manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to pods              |
| **Update Strategy**   | No built-in support for rolling updates or rollback                         | Supports rolling updates, pause/resume, and rollback                      |
| **Abstraction Level** | Lower-level controller                                                      | Higher-level abstraction built on top of ReplicaSet                       |

### What is a DaemonSet and when do you use it
- A DaemonSet is a Kubernetes workload resource that ensures a specific pod runs on all (or some) nodes in the cluster.
  - Key Characteristics:
    - Runs one copy of a Pod per node.
    - Automatically adds the Pod to new nodes that are added to the cluster.
    - Removes the Pod from nodes when they are removed from the cluster.
- You use a DaemonSet when you need to run background or node-level system services on every node.

### How do you expose a pod outside the cluster
- `kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=NodePort --port=80`

### How do you perform rolling updates and rollbacks
- Rolling Updates:
  - `kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <container-name>=<new-image>`
  - `kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>`
  - `kubectl get rs` 
- Rollback to the previous revision
  - `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>` 
- Rollback to a specific revision:
  - `kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=2` 
- View revision history (if kubectl rollout history is available):
  - `kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>` 


### What is the difference between ClusterIP and NodePort

| Feature              | **ClusterIP**                                      | **NodePort**                                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default Type**     | ‚úÖ Yes                                              | ‚ùå No                                                  |
| **Access Scope**     | Internal only (within the cluster)                | Exposes service externally on each Node‚Äôs IP + port   |
| **External Access**  | ‚ùå Not accessible from outside the cluster         | ‚úÖ Yes, using `NodeIP:NodePort`                        |
| **Use Case**         | Service-to-service communication inside cluster    | Quick external access for dev/test environments        |
| **Port Range**       | Any valid service port (e.g., 80, 8080)           | 30000‚Äì32767 (default range)                           |
| **Security**         | More secure (internal traffic only)               | Less secure (publicly exposed)                        |
| **Example Command**  | `kubectl expose deployment app --type=ClusterIP`  | `kubectl expose deployment app --type=NodePort`       |


### What is RBAC in Kubernetes
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a Kubernetes mechanism used to control access to resources based on the user‚Äôs role.
- It helps you define who can do what within your Kubernetes cluster.
