# Kubernetes Learning Notes

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

Key features:
- Automates deployment and management of containerized apps
- Provides scaling capabilities
- Handles high traffic loads by distributing across multiple servers
- Prevents downtime through self-healing and load balancing

## Kubernetes Orchestration

Kubernetes acts as a conductor/orchestrator that controls the behavior of all container-based running applications, similar to how a band master coordinates musicians.

## Kubernetes Cluster

When we deploy Kubernetes, we get a cluster consisting of:

1. **Master Node**:
   - Uses API server to manage worker nodes
   - The control plane that makes global decisions

2. **Worker Nodes**:
   - Can be virtual or physical machines
   - Run the actual containerized applications

**Cluster**: A group of nodes (workers) managed by the master.
### Listing Nodes
 - To view all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster, you can use the
 -  ```
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
   - Command. Adding the -o wide option will give you more detailed information, such as the internal and external IP addresses of the nodes, the operating system image, the kernel version, and the container runtime version used on each node.

### Describing a Node
 - For a more detailed view of a specific node, use the
 -  ```
    kubectl describe node NODE_NAME
    ```
   - command. This provides additional information such as labels, annotations, taints, a list of running pods on that node, allocated resources, and recent events related to that node.

### Draining a Node
 - When you need to perform maintenance on a node (such as installing updates or software), it's best to first drain the node. Draining means safely evicting all the pods from the node so that it can be updated without affecting the workload. You can do this using the command
 -  ```
    kubectl drain NODE_NAME
    ```


## Kubernetes Components

Core components include:
- API server
- Container Runtime
- ETCD (key-value store)
- Kube Proxy
- Scheduler
- Kubelet
- Kube Controller

## Administration/Architecture

Key architectural elements:
- API
- Namespaces
- PODs
- Deployments
- ReplicaSets
- StatefulSets
- DaemonSets
- Services
- Ingress Controllers
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Storage
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Jobs, CronJobs
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)
- Helm
## Namespaces in Kubernetes


## PODs

- Smallest unit in Kubernetes
- An environment that runs containers inside itself
- A Pod can contain one or more containers

## Benefits of Kubernetes

- Container Orchestration
- Scalability
- Load Balancing
- High Availability
- Rollouts and Rollback capabilities

## Getting Started with Minikube

Minikube is used to learn Kubernetes without connecting to cloud services.

### Basic Commands

```
# Start Minikube
minikube start
```
```
# Stop Minikube
minikube stop
```
```
# Delete Minikube cluster
minikube delete
```
```
# Check status
minikube status
```
### Create the Pod
```
kubectl create deployment my-ngnix --image=ngnix:latest
```
```
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=appname
```
if its in docker hub then it would take from there else we need to provide the complete path

### List all Kubernetes Deployments
```
kubectl get deployments
```
This would give the output as:
| NAME      | READY | UP-TO-DATE | AVAILABLE | AGE |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------|-----|
| my-nginx  | 1/1   | 1          | 1         | 2m  |

Where Each column hold the information of Pod
| Column | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NAME** | The name of the deployment (e.g., `my-nginx`) |
| **READY** | How many pods are ready vs. how many are expected (e.g., 1/1) |
| **UP-TO-DATE** | Number of pods updated to the latest deployment configuration |
| **AVAILABLE** | Number of pods available to serve requests |
| **AGE** | How long ago the deployment was created |

### List all running PODS
```
kubectl get pods
```

### Web-based UI to manage and monitor the local minikube cluster

```
minikube dashboard
```

### Provide The service
 - A Service is an abstraction that exposes a set of Pods as a network service. Even if Pods die and get replaced, the service keeps the same DNS name and IP.

- To expose a service for your application in Kubernetes, you can use the following command:

```
kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```
- In Kubernetes, Pods are temporary and dynamic ‚Äî they can be killed, restarted, or rescheduled at any time. That means:
    - üîÅ **Pod IP addresses can change**: When a Pod is rescheduled or recreated, its IP address may change.
    - ‚ùå **You can't rely on a Pod‚Äôs IP to reach your app consistently**: Since Pods are ephemeral, their IPs are not stable.
    - üß≠ **There‚Äôs no built-in way to route traffic to your app**: Without a service, it‚Äôs difficult to ensure that traffic is routed to the correct Pod, especially when Pods are constantly changing.
- Real-World Analogy for Service Providing
- Imagine a **restaurant kitchen** (representing Pods) where cooks change daily. Customers (users) don‚Äôt remember which cook is working ‚Äî they just order from the **counter** (representing the **Service**), which always knows where the cooks are.
   -  **Pods** are like the cooks: Their IPs can change or be replaced.
   -  **Services** are like the counter: They provide a stable endpoint to reliably serve customers, even if the cooks (Pods) change.


### Run pod in local browser
```
minikube service my-nginix 
```
- this command is used to access a Kubernetes service running in your Minikube cluster from your local machine's browser. When you run minikube service my-nginx, Minikube will:
 + ***Open a Tunnel/Proxy***: It starts a local proxy to the service running inside Minikube.
 + ***Open the Web Browser***: It will automatically open the service in your default web browser.
 + ***Access the Service***: You can now interact with the service (e.g., a web app like NGINX, database, etc.).

### Delete POD:
```
kubectl delete deployment my-app
```

### List all service in Kubernetes cluster
```
kubectl get services
```
- This command lists all the services in your Kubernetes cluster. Services in Kubernetes provide a stable network endpoint for accessing a set of Pods (containers), and they can route traffic to the appropriate Pod(s) based on the service type (e.g., ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, etc.).
