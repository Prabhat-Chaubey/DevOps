##  Redis-DB Pod Fix for Kubernetes

### Task Overview

This task involves troubleshooting and fixing a failing **`redis-db` pod** deployed in the `trouble` namespace in a Kubernetes environment. The pod was stuck in a **`CrashLoopBackOff`** state due to a typo in the container's command.

### Problem Description

The `redis-db` pod failed to start properly due to a typo in the command section of the pod definition. Specifically, the command `sleeep` was used instead of the correct `sleep` command. This caused the pod to fail repeatedly, entering a crash loop.

### Solution

The issue was resolved by editing the pod definition to use the correct `sleep` command. After fixing the command, the pod was deleted and recreated to apply the changes.


### Steps Taken

### 1. Check Pod Status

First, the status of the pod was checked using the following command:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n trouble
```
### 2. Inspect the Pod Description
+ The next step was to inspect the pod's detailed description to understand the issue:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod redis-db -n trouble
  ```
+ This revealed that the pod was failing because of an incorrect command.
### 3. Check Logs for Further Details
+ To confirm the exact issue, the logs for the redis-db pod were examined:
  ```bash
  kubectl logs redis-db -n trouble
  ```
### 4. Edit the Pod Command
+ To fix the issue, the pod definition was edited to replace sleeep with the correct sleep command. This was done using the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl edit pod redis-db -n trouble
  ```
### 5. Delete and Recreate the Pod
After fixing the command, the pod was deleted and recreated to apply the change:
```bash
kubectl delete pod redis-db -n trouble
kubectl apply -f redis-fixed.yaml
```
